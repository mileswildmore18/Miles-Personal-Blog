# Miles-Personal-Blog

![alt text](<screenshot of website.jpg>)

Here you get a chance to add some blogs to this page with your name, the title of your blog, and the content of your choice of what topic you want to talk about.

The main idea for this blog is to showcase about filling in information with your own imagination, and to make sure all of the content is filled in before you get a chance to witness any of the information made by other users who have shared their experiences with it.

You are offered the option of choosing which mode you are most comfortable with using the light and dark mode button when you visit the website depending on if you want the page to be bright, or dark.

What I have learned from this was how to store all of the information onto the local storage with using the JavaScript language to work alongside the HTML and the CSS files that are linked to each other and where the JavaScript can control where the HTML section left off. I also learned how to create functions to specific tasks of each variable when they are put into action with coding and adding new content to the blog page.

When any of the information you put in, they will be stored on the Local Storage unit to save information on the website with the forms you have submitted.

After you have visited the blog page after you put in all of your content in, on the footer of the website, you get a chance to be shown my past work that navigates to my portfolio, along with the e-mail address you can contact me at.

Have fun with adding blogs to the web with any of the ideas you want to share to me and everyone out their on the internet!
